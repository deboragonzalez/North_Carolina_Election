# North Carolina's Ninth District 2018 Election
2018 Live Polls Election Data

This project explores North Carolina's 9th district data from the 2018 election. I explore the political affiliation of those surveyed by race considering the weight variable. I further explore the data by comparing the distribution of political affiliation by gender and education level.
